# RemoteBot

RemoteBot is a remoted controlled vehicle designed for remote physical data collection. It will be implemeted using a MSP430FR4133 as the remoted microcontroller and coded using Code Composer Studio from TI and a C++/java app for linux/pc/android for control and data storage. 

Steps:
1. ~~Establish remote connection from Windows/Linux/raspberryPi to MSP430FR4133 microcontroller (done)~~
2. Create bluetooth UART transceivers apps for both windows/linux and MSP430FR4133 
3. Create vehicle with sensor transmitters
4. Implement support for controller controls
5. ?Implement visual sensor on vehicle for autonomous driving
6. ?Add real-time camera feed from vehicle to host machine
