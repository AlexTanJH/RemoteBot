# RemoteBot

RemoteBot is a remoted controlled vehicle designed for remote physical data collection. It will be implemeted using a MSP430FR4133 as the remoted microcontroller and coded using Code Composer Studio from TI and a C++/java app for linux/pc/android for control and data storage. 

Steps:
1. ~~Establish remote connection from Windows/Linux/raspberryPi to MSP430FR4133 microcontroller (done)~~
2. ~~Create bluethooth UART transceiver drivers for MSP430~~
3. Create bluetooth transceivers apps for Android 
4. Hook up MSP430 with physical hardware (motors, h-bridges, power rails)
5. ?Implement support for controller controls
6. ?Implement visual sensor on vehicle for autonomous driving (swap to new mcu or use a raspberry pi? for more compute power)
7. ?Add real-time camera feed from vehicle to host machine (swap to new mcu or use a raspberry pi?)
